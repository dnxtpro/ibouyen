    Berrad 
    
    “Ronda by Ibouyen” is a new reflection and reinterpretation of the most famous card game in Morocco, a card game found in several Mediterranean countries, probably transmitted by the Gypsies throughout the North of the Mediterranean then in the Maghreb. 

    In this version, the artist replaces the cups with teapots, the teapots (Berrad in darija) remind us of moments from the past, moments spent with family or alone, shared intimacy, a sweet nostalgia
    
    In each of them, we see reflections and different shapes, making each teapot unique, a sort of mirror of the intimate, moments frozen as in instant photos. 
    
    Among the four objects, this one is the most intimate, focusing on the individual, it invites us to observe our own reflection, a dreamlike world of forms captured on the metal of the teapot, a bit like the first films using money to freeze the light. 
    
    This was the first object, the beginning of this project, the beginning of a journey into the world of symbols.

    <h1 className='w-1/12'>The coins from the original card game are replaced by faces, the circular shape is repeated, but we discover faces (Kemmara) with distinct and diverse features.
    
    This object is inspired by the heterogeneity found in North Africa, we see different faces and different Amazigh tattoos which represent symbols of nature, mainly those related to the lunar.
    
    Oddly enough, the faces in the deck of cards remind us of full moons, but not only that.
    
    This time, the object transcends the individual and shows the community, the regional: a unity in diversity, a fight to maintain authenticity, even in a world which tends towards standardization.

  <div className='w-1/5 perso'> The “Nejma” (stars in Arabic) are the crosses or stars of Agadez, we can find them in jewelry and decorative designs of several ethnic groups in North Africa.
    
    This fascinating symbol is the first star that appears in the sky, the star that guides the nomads in the desert, “the eye of God” as the “blue men” call it, symbol of eternal beginnings, it guides them towards truth and justice.
    
    The swords of the original game, which are tools of war, are replaced in the version of “Ibouyen” by a transcendental symbol and guidance.
    
    In Amazigh mythology, the first star that appears in the sky is the goddess “Taïa”, daughter of “Ayyour”: the moon, she is the engendered mother and the mother who will engender the other stars, following her appearance.

    <div className='w-1/5 perso'>  Finally, the sticks from the original game turn into statues. Statues that can be found in different cultures throughout the world and history. 
    
    They might seem disconnected, but the human prevails, because the human is the only living being to play cards, to play his life sometimes through choices.
    
    To unify them in this deck of cards, the primordial color, there are four main colors: blue, green, brown and purple. The statues contain, to a certain extent, all these nuances.
    
    We move from the transcendental to the corporeal, to the tangible. We extend the regional to the global. We can appreciate how interest in the body is universal. The further we move away, the more we can appreciate what is near.
    
    “The symbol is used to recognize oneself.”</div>
